## About the project

Migration is a complex phenomenon that can have both positive and negative economic impacts and it is influeced by many socio-economical variables. In this project we make a deep analysis of the migration in the Americas to provide useful insights, reccomendations and predictions for a Migration NGO, using a variety of specialized tools.

### Goals

+ General Objectives

  + Analyze migratory flows in the Americas, with a particular focus on countries with a higher net migration.
  + Understand how economic factors influence migratory flows in both countries of origin and destination.

+ Specific Objectives

  + Analyze the trend of how forced displacement impacts migration patterns in both countries of origin and destination.
  + Study the main destinations of migrants and analyze the reasons behind their choices.
  + Identify countries that are more vulnerable and have a higher incidence of migration.

### Scope

+ Target Business: International NGO
+ Geographical Area: Americas
+ Period: 2007-2022
+ Data Sources: World Bank, United Nations (UN), International Organization for Migration (IOM), Displacement Monitoring Center (DMC)

## KPIs

These were designed following the SMART methodology (Specific-Measurable-Achievable-Relevant-Timely):

+ **Net Migration Rate**: Measures the difference between the number of people leaving a country and the number of people arriving. The goal is to reduce the rate by 10% in the next two years through programs that incentivize the population to stay in the country.

+ **Forced Displacement Rate**: Measures the number of people who have been forcibly displaced due to armed conflicts, natural disasters, or other causes. The goal is to reduce the forced displacement rate by 20% in the next five years through the implementation of measures to protect human rights.

+ **Migratory Vulnerability Index**: Measures a country's ability to cope with migratory flows. The goal is to improve this index by 10% in the next three years.

+ **Percentage of Migrants Sending Remittances**: Measures a country's ability to retain highly skilled workers within its territory. The goal is to improve this index by 15% in the next three years through policies and programs that incentivize the retention of such workers in the country.

+ **Operational Efficiency, NGO Management**
Refers to the NGO's ability to use its resources efficiently. This KPI is measured as the percentage of resources allocated to the NGO's main mission compared to overhead and administrative expenses. The goal is to increase the percentage of resources allocated to the main mission by 5% within one year.

## Dashboards

We have designed several dashboards to monitor the social and economic situation of the countries as well as the migratory vulnerability.

## Streamlit

This tool was used to visualize the data generated by the different prediction models generated for this project in real time [ML tool](https://github.com/cristos34/PF-MigracionEnAmerica/blob/main/StreamlitMigracionDeployEn-io/StreamlitNewML.py).

## Pipelines

Inside this folder you can find the 2 pipelines scripts: one is used to extract and load and the second one is used to transform the data already loaded in the data warehouse. This process is fully automated.
